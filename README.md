# Arduino-Adventure
This repository is based on all the Arduino Uno based projects that I have coded.

-> Adafruit_Sensor-master.zip is a master library for Arduino. You can download it
and install it by - opening arduino ide
                  - click on sketch -> include libraries -> add .zip libraries
                  - then select the library from the dowload location
                  - hit enter and save

-> Follow the same steps to install the master zip library for ADXL345 sensor - Arduino-ADXL345-master.zip

-> For the given Arduino codes, use the comments to understand the codes better.

-> For the schematic diagram for the projects, use the pin data from the code to make connections between 
the arduino and the other sensors.
  You can update the pins according to your choice while interfacing the sensors.
  
-> The sensors, motors, drivers, displays and other components interfaced in these projects are:
    - Accelerometer ADXL345
    - Servo motor SG90
    - LCD 16x2
    - OLED
    - Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
    - RFID reader/writer RC522
    - Gas sensors MQ2, MQ9 and MQ135
    - DC geared motors 12V 150rpm
    - LEDs
    - Push buttons
    - Sound sensor RKI-3103
    - PIR motion sensor HC-SR501
    - DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor
    - L293D and L298N motor drivers
    - 100k potentiometers
